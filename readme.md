# SimpleAudioPlayer - Android App

This repo is the code for a simple audio player in android using the `androidx.media3` library to do so.
This is a simple project mostly to learn how to code android apps using Kotlin, and Jetpack Compose.
I have learned how to make basic iOS apps using Swift, so I will be trying to translate what I learned there to here.

Since this is a learning project, the project is mostly the same as the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrcmjIW45u8) from HoodLab, with some modifications/ 
additions to my part.

Also used the documentation for Media3 from Google, sparingly however, since the documentation is more geared towards veteran Android developers, so I found it somewhat 
vague on how to setup Media3 components to play Audio files, and connect these components to Jetpack Compose views.

A future app where I build a video player by myself, using this project (when completed) as a guide, might be in the works later!

## Running the code
For best experience, please use Android Studio to run the code.
